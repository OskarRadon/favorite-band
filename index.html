    <h1>Animal Collective</h1>
    <img src="img/animal-collective.jpg">
    <p>Animal Collective is an American experimental pop group formed in Baltimore, Maryland in 1999. They were founded by Avey Tare (David Portner), Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), Deakin (Josh Dibb), and Geologist (Brian Weitz). Records released under the name Animal Collective may include contributions from any or all of these members; the lineup is not uniform, though Portner and Lennox have been on every Animal Collective release.</p>

    <p>The band's music is characterized by studio experimentation, vocal harmonies, and an exploration of various genres which include freak folk, noise rock, ambient drone, and psychedelia. The group also runs the record label Paw Tracks on which they have released their own material as well as that of other artists. In 2009, the band released their most commercially successful album, Merriweather Post Pavilion, which Uncut magazine called: "one of the landmark American albums of the century so far".</p>
